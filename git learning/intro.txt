Hello

My name is Rahul Saini. I am from Jaipur. I am doing my b.tech from NIT Delhi and the graduation year is 2023.

So in this Assignment I have learned about the git Feature and also learn how to use github using git. So I did learn about the what is git? 
and why we use git? and how we can create the repositories in github and do all the work using git?
I did also learn about the cloning, pushing, pulling and commiting the code using git.

Basically the git is a version control system which is used to do all the work of github using CLI.

So first we setup our configuration using 
->git config --global user.name "username"
->git config --global user.email "useremail"

after that we will initialize git in the project folder by
->git init

Now go to the github and create a repo there. copy the url and do
->git remote add origin url

the setup is done.
now we can do some work and features by git:

Cloning:
creating a copy of the repo to your local storage is known as clonning. to do that go to the code copy the url link and run this command
-> git clone url

pushing:
In this method we will update the changes to the files present in the repo by :
->git push -u origin main

And some more commands are there:
->git status   (used to see that there are some pandings or not to commit)
->git log      (used to see all the commit information)
->git add "filename"  
->git add .    (to add all the changes)
->ls     ( to list the files)
->ls -a   (to list all the file including hidden also)
->git commit -m "msg"
->git branch  (to see all the branches)
->git checkout branchname   (to change the branch)
->git checkout commidId      (to see that commit)
->git checkout -b branchname (create and to change the branch)
->git branch branchname    (to create branch name)
->git diff (this is used to see what we have changed in the files/used before the git add .)
